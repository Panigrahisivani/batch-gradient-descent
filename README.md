# Batch Gradient Descent From Scratch

![Loss Curve](plots/loss_curve.png)

This repository contains a complete implementation of **Batch Gradient Descent** for linear regression using Python and NumPy.  
Both **single-variate** and **multi-variate** gradient descent are implemented, along with evaluation metrics and visualizations.

## Overview

Batch Gradient Descent updates parameters using the entire dataset at each iteration. It is stable, deterministic, and widely used for linear regression.
